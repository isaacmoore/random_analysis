127,26,"""Nitro Circus Spectacular""","November 3, 2016","Murr, then Sal",1.23[122]
"In this supersized 2-hour episode, a Nitro Circus/X-Games inspired obstacle course was presented and aside from clips of regular challenges filmed prior to this live special, viewers were shown clips of the Jokers preparing to run the course; the Joker who then ran the course the fastest won $100,000 for a charity of their choice. As Q was injured during the guys' training sessions with Travis Pastrana, he was not cleared by doctors to compete in the actual obstacle course and chose Joey Fatone to perform in his place again. Challenges included getting strangers to watch their apartment, a trip back to the Castle of White, and a spin on the Wheel of ""Now!"".
Punishment: This episode featured 2 punishments - one for the losing joker after a regular episode's worth of challenges played and an automatic punishment for the joker who received the most votes from the public leading up to and during this episode. Murr lost the regular challenges and had to participate as an obstacle for professional jumpers to bike around and over on the Nitro Circus track. Sal, who got the most votes from the public, was hoisted into the air via harness and swung around for a bit. He was brought down to rest for a minute before being hoisted again and sent flying into a giant ""cake"". Despite the Punishments, Murr had the fastest time, and won $100,000 for his Charity: Make a Wish Foundation.",,,,,
